       "As of mid-2025, several AI agent frameworks have emerged, each offering unique capabilities for developing intelligent, autonomous systems.\n",
       "\n",
       "**LangChain** is a prominent open-source framework that facilitates the creation of applications powered by large language models (LLMs). Its modular design supports various LLMs, including OpenAI, Anthropic, Cohere, Hugging Face, and local models. LangChain provides tools for chaining prompts, models, memory, and external tools, enabling the development of complex workflows such as question-answering bots and document processors. However, advanced workflows may require a solid understanding of prompt engineering and LLM behavior.

       "\n",
       "**LangGraph**, an extension of LangChain, focuses on managing stateful, branching processes using a graph-based architecture for agent interaction. It offers explicit control over information flow, allowing for branching and debugging of complex agent behaviors. This framework is particularly suitable for applications requiring extensive data retrieval and knowledge fusion, such as research settings.

       "\n",
       "**AutoGen**, developed by Microsoft, specializes in orchestrating multiple AI agents to form autonomous, event-driven systems capable of handling complex, multi-agent tasks seamlessly. It is tightly integrated with Microsoft's Semantic Kernel and Azure services, making it ideal for enterprise-level applications needing event-driven workflows, such as customer service automation.

       "\n",
       "**CrewAI** is a Python-based framework tailored for orchestrating collaborative AI agents in complex, multi-step workflows across varied domains. Its role-based architecture enables developers to define agents with specialized responsibilities and control task execution through sequential, parallel, or conditional logic flows. CrewAI is well-suited for interactive storytelling, multi-step chatbots, and strategic simulations.

       "**Amazon Bedrock AgentCore** is a platform designed to simplify the development and deployment of advanced AI agents. It includes modular services supporting the full production lifecycle, such as AgentCore Runtime for scalable serverless deployment, AgentCore Memory for context management, and AgentCore Identity for secure service access. This platform emphasizes flexibility, allowing developers to use only the components they need, facilitating scalable and secure AI agent development.
